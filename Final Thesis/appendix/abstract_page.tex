This physics dissertation project aims to develop a game physics engine that can accurately simulate realistic physical interactions between objects in a virtual environment. The focus will be on implementing algorithms that can accurately model rigid body dynamics and collision mechanics while ensuring optimal performance. The resulting game engine will be tested and evaluated through the creation of a physics-based game, demonstrating the engine's ability to provide a compelling and immersive gameplay experience while following the laws of physics.
