	abstract = {The acceleration of a vehicle or a bicycle is commonly used in elementary physics courses to illustrate problems concerning Newtonâ€™s laws of motion when friction forces are involved. The maximum possible acceleration is rarely discussed, although it is of interest to consumers and racing car enthusiasts, and it is sometimes questioned by students. It is the main focus of the present article and is considered from a basic physics point of view, appropriate for classroom discussion.},
